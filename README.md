# Game Design Projct
For the final project of Art and Code, we will be building a game using all of the p5.js skills that you have learned in this course! For this final project, you are free to design a game of your choosing.This game should 
- Be interactive 
- Allow for the user to control the outputs of the game.
- Have different levels


## Project Requirements
**Your final program should have**:
- At least three different levels are present that are controlled by a variable (e.g. score changes level)
- Ability to control game aspects using key and/or mouse commands.
